## Configure Shopware and the Sale channel

### Currency

> ðŸš© **Note:**
>
> TWINT payment extension requires the Currency to be **CHF** so we need to make sure **CHF** currency is available for the front store (as know as the Sale channel).
>
> If you already have **CHF** currency created please ignore this section.

#### 1. Login to the Admin console panel

#### 2. Go to `Settings -> Currencies`

- Click `Add currency` button
- Enter the currency information as desired. For example:
    - **Name:** Swiss francs
    - **ISO code:** CHF
    - **Short name:** *anything*
    - **Symbol:** Fr
    - **Conversion factor:**
        - If CHF is the only currency: Enter `1`
        - If your shop support multiple currency:
            - CHF is the first one: Enter `1`
            - CHF is not the first currency: Enter the conversion rate against the first currency *i.e.* `1.1` for `CHF = 1st currency * 1.1`
- Make change to the `Price rounding` section, especially the `Decimals` field for the displayed decimal places in the front store.
- Click the `Save` button.
